The following CSS rule may cause unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This rule sets the `width` to `100%` and `box-sizing` to `border-box`.  While seemingly harmless, it can lead to unexpected horizontal scrollbars if the element's content (including padding and border) exceeds the available width of its parent container.
