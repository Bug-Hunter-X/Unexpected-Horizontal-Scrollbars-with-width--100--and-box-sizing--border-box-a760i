Several solutions exist:

**1. Adjust Content Width:**

The most reliable solution is to ensure that the content within the div (including padding and borders) does not exceed the available width of its parent container. This might involve using max-width, adjusting padding and border sizes, or using flexible box layouts.

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  max-width: 95%; /*Example adjustment */
}
```

**2. Overflow-x: hidden; (Use with Caution):**

This solution hides any content that overflows the horizontal boundaries.  However, it's crucial to understand that this simply hides the problem; it doesn't address the root cause and might lead to content being cut off.

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

**3. Flexible Box Layout:**

Using flexbox or grid layout provides more control over element sizing and alignment, potentially avoiding the need for `width: 100%` altogether. This is often a better long-term solution for complex layouts.

Choose the solution that best fits your specific needs and design. Consider carefully if hiding overflow is appropriate for your use case.
